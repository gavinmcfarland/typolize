						<h4>Overview</h4>

						<p style="font-size: var(--font-size-2);">Renting is a process that many people will experience
							in their lifetime and it can be a
							scary,
							stressful and overwhelming process. Having been a renter myself I was ecstatic when I was
							asked
							to collaborate with a small startup to help them conceptualise a new, more intuitive rental
							service.</p>

						<h6>Role</h6>
						<p>Investigate existing process, discover user pain points, conduct user interviews,

					<div span="5">

						<p>Originally the service was intended as a way to helping landlords and estate agents to
							spot bad tenants. Through meetings with expert matter holders, customer interviews and
							surveys we gathered research and insight about Tenants, Landlords and Estate Agents to
							learn about their habits, goals, motivations, lifestyles and needs. But this quickly
							pivoted the purpose of the product to reward good tenants and help them through the
							rental process.</p>

						<h4>Renting in London</h4>
						<p>I thought it would be useful to get a better understanding of the details and events of the
							rental process. The flow diagram on the left is an early draft of a typical rental process
							in London. I’ve written hypothetical dates to get an understanding of the timeframe between
							events while thinking about the thoughts and feelings a renter might be having during this
							process.</p>
						<h4>Rapid Prototyping</h4>
						<p>It’s important to have a good understanding how the prototype will behave which is why I
							created this flow diagram of the Agent flow which shows the order and interactions of each
							screens. The act of creating this diagram was more important the actual output as it allows
							me to challenge my thoughts about what information should be asked for and when. I did the
							same for the Tenant flow.</p>
						<h4>Finished Screens</h4>
						<p>At such a high level of thinking, the solution for the service went through so many possible
							outcomes. But without a way to visualise the service, it was difficult to quantify it’s
							value. Creating a prototype helped demonstrate the problem they were solving for and how it
							could be achieved. We used this prototype to present to, users, stakeholders and potential
							investors.</p>
